  **Player Shops**
  To make a shop, place a sign on a barrel that matches this format:

  &7Line 1:&r [Shop]
  &7Line 2:&r <description>
  &7Line 3:&r <cost>
  &7Line 4:&r <blank>

  Also see: [Spawn Rules](underlined dark_blue Rules for shops in spawn run_command=/book shop rules)
- |-
  Make sure your barrel is in a [claimed region](underlined dark_blue How to claim regions run_command=/book claims)!

  For example:
  &7Line 1:&r [Shop]
  &7Line 2:&r Golden Apples
  &7Line 3:&r 3 diamonds
  &7Line 4:&r
